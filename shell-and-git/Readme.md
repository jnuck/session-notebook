# How to create a remote repository

1. Inside your project folder run "git init" to initialize the folder as a git repository.

2. On GitHub, create a new repository. Preferably with the same name as your project folder which was initialized in the first step.

3. Copy the SSH Repository address from GitHub and run _git remote add origin "ssh link"_

4. Add files from your local repository and commit them, using a descriptive commit message.

5. Push your files to the main brach of the remote repository using _git push -u origin main_
